<p>When changing the interface of Dynamics 365 to Unified Interface, if by any chance you don't see the New Button to create entities, or even if the entities are read-only even being System Administrator, only thing you need to do is:</p>
<p>- Go to Advanced Settings like in the image below:</p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2019/08/settings.png" />&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>- Then, go entity by entity and uncheck the following setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Unified Interface act as Mobile version apparently, even accessing from the browser in your desktop or laptop. Publish settings and should work.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>
