<p>How often we have to delete components from a solution and it says (<span> <span>You can’t delete any solution component that has dependencies on another solution component. </span> </span>)</p>

<p>There we download the file and dig in there for the reason, why not to develop a piece of code to help us on that? Yes, the target in here is more technical, however in any team we will need to have a developer, so ask him. :)</p>

<p>Below the requests that can be called for that purpose.</p>


<p><span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.8;">The following table lists the messages that you can use to retrieve data about solution component dependencies.</span><br /></p>
<p>


    <table>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th><b>Message </b></th>
                <th><b>Description </b></th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p> <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.crm.sdk.messages.retrievedependentcomponentsrequest.aspx">RetrieveDependentComponentsRequest </a> </p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>Returns a list of dependencies for solution components that directly depend on a solution component. </p>
                    <p>For example, when you use this message for a global option set solution component, dependency records for solution components representing any option set attributes that reference the global option set solution component are returned. </p>
                    <p>When you use this message for the solution component record for the account entity, dependency records for all of the solution components representing attributes, views, and forms used for that entity are returned. </p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>Returns a list of the dependencies for solution components that another solution component directly depends on. This message provides the reverse of the <b>RetrieveDependentComponentsRequest </b> <span>  </span>message. </p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>Returns a list of all the dependencies for solution components that could prevent deleting a solution component. </p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p> <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.crm.sdk.messages.retrievedependenciesforuninstallrequest.aspx">RetrieveDependenciesForUninstallRequest </a> </p>

                <td>
                    <p>Returns a list of all the dependencies for solution components that could prevent uninstalling a managed solution. </p>
