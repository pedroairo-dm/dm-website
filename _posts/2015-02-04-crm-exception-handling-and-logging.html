<p><font size="2">Every single day as a CRM Developer, one of my main concerns is in case of an exception is how to deal in the exception and save the information.</font><font size="2"><br /></font><font size="2">Years ago, and with no CRM Online, our team was saving that information in a file, with our way of gathering the information (friendly message, message, level (low, high,..), type of exception (crm data access, plugins, workflows, java scripts, web extensions), stack trace, and all in a xml type form so we could easily check what was happening in the crm.<br /> </font><font size="2"><br /></font><font size="2">However, everything changed when we start to implement in Online, we couldn't use a file system approach, so we started to use an Entity for that purpose, with the same information, but because we were using an OO approach the only change was in one method only, and with this way we can use in both environments.</font><font size="2"><br /></font><font size="2">What is your opinion?Â </font></p>
