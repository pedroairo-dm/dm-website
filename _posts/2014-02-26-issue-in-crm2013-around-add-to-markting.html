<p>In a customer i was having a issue with the 'Add to Markting List' button on the contact form, but it was giving that error only in a new form that we have created. So, after research, I found on this post the workaround or fix to it. <a href="https://community.dynamics.com/crm/f/117/t/118904.aspx" target="_blank">https://community.dynamics.com/crm/f/117/t/118904.aspx</a></p>
<p>I added the list of cases to the form and i've hidden the tab, and now is working.</span></span></div>
