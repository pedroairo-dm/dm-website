<p><font size="3">A user was trying to download a note attachment when the message &quot;Invalid Action&quot; just appeared in the browser.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><br /></font><font size="3">The first thing i did was using my old friend Diag Tool where i saw the exception &quot;The key specified to compute a hash value is expired, only active keys are valid.&quot;, i have found as well that in the Event Viewer.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><br /></font><font size="3">Doing some research i saw that restarting the MS CRM Asynchronous Processing Service or running the executable from the Tools folder inside CRM folder Microsoft.Crm.Tools.WRPCKeyRenewal.exe /R, i could solve the problem.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><br /></font><font size="3">I did that, i restarted the server and in the end, the same problem. What do you do in this situations, just google it a little bit more, so, after 5 minutes someone had the same issue, and that one more step neededto be done, <b>Clear the Browser Data on the client side was the solution</b>.</font></p>
<p><font size="3"><br /></font><font size="3">Hope it helps.</font></p>
