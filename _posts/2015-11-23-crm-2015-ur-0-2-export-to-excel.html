<p><font size="2">Just found today after installing UR 0.2 for CRM 2015 that when exporting data, i didn't have anymore the check box for being able to import data again back to crm.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><br /></font></p>
<p><font size="2">However, opening the excel file i have found that the columns were starting in 'D' instead of 'A', so it means that we no longer need to set any check box for that.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><br /></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Another thing i really liked was, the excel file extension changed from .xls to .xlsx and in here i have to say that i was expecting this even since CRM 2013 or something. Now that is done, i would say, is always better later than never. :)</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><br /></font></p>
<p><font size="2">Good news as well, it is possible to import an XLSX file. Saying this because i have tested.</font></p>

<p><i><u><font size="2">Thank you Microsoft.</font></u></i></p>
