<p>Just found today after installing UR 0.2 for CRM 2015 that when exporting data, i didn't have anymore the check box for being able to import data again back to crm.</p>

<p>However, opening the excel file i have found that the columns were starting in 'D' instead of 'A', so it means that we no longer need to set any check box for that.</p>

<p>Another thing i really liked was, the excel file extension changed from .xls to .xlsx and in here i have to say that i was expecting this even since CRM 2013 or something. Now that is done, i would say, is always better later than never. :)</p>

<p>Good news as well, it is possible to import an XLSX file. Saying this because i have tested.</p>

<p><i><u>Thank you Microsoft.</u></i></p>
