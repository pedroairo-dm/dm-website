<span >Retrieving in a Create Syncronous Plugin the count of the records from the same type of entity from a Query Expression gives a timeout.&nbsp;</span>
<br /><span ><br />The reason is because the CRM locks the record.&nbsp;</span>
<br /><span ><br />To overcome this problem you need to set the property NoLock to "true".</span></p>
