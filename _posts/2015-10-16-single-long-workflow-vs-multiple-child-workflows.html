<p>Usually i'm more for plugins instead of workflows, here it is more a personal opinion, but i never say, never develop a workflow to someone, and i develop workflows if they make sense.</p>

<p>In this case, lets assume that for some requirement is better to develop a workflow instead of something else.</p>

<p>Let's assume as well to make sense that that workflow will be used for multiple scenarios.Â </p>

<p>So, in here, should we use a long workflow or a workflow with multiple child workflows?</p>

<p>Based on some articles from the SDK and Technet, we should prefer to develop a long one, and why? The reason is that <i>&quot;t<span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.8;">he overhead occurs when all entities that are used in the workflow are retrieved and the child workflow is started in a two-step process that includes a 'Workflow Expansion Task' and the actual workflow instance. Therefore, for maximum throughput, use a single long workflow.&quot;</span></i></p>
