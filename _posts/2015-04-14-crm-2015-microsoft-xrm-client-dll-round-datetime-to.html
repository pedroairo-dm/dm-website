<p>Having a look on my CRM Bible (SDK), i have found a Enumeration to Round Dates to: Day, Hour, Minute, Second and Month. So, i had to test that.</p>

<p>Always good to know this things, instead of doing extra lines of code or using other libraries for this, why not using default capabilities of CRM dlls.</p>

<p><span>DateTime dt = Microsoft.Xrm.Client.DateTimeExtensions.Round(DateTime.Now, Microsoft.Xrm.Client.RoundTo.Day);</span><br /></p>

<p><span>Result will be:<span>{15/04/2015 00:00:00}</span></span></p>
