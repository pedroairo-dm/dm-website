<p><font size="2">I was creating a report from the CRM 2015 Report Wizard and i just ran the Report where i saw that a date time column was appearing two times, one with the formatted value from my options, in the case English(Ireland) format (01/01/2016 03:00:00) and the next unformatted, something like 2016/01/01 03:00:00 AM.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">After digging quite a bit i have discovered that the Body XML on the database had the column in there, and for me, no direct updates/deletes/creates in the database, so i tried to find the reason.</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><span style="line-height:23.4px;">I have discovered from one of my search results that inside the folder (your drive)/<span>Program FilesMicrosoft Dynamics CRMSetupServiceabilityLatestActions_OrgInstall the file (<span>dbupdate_37910.sql) could solve the problem. </span></span></span></font></p>

<p><font size="2"><span>I have opened the file where i saw: </span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span><u>-- CRMSE 37910 - Wizard reports when exported to excel should not duplicate the unformatted columns.</u></span></font></p>

<p><font size="2"><span>Having in mind that probably those files that start with &quot;dbupdate_&quot; will solve few issues similar to this one.</span></font></p>

<p><font size="2"><span>For me, i will give more attention to that folder from now on.</span></font></p>

<p><font size="2"><span style="line-height:23.4px;">Before running the sql against each organization i advise you to perform a <u><b>BACKUP </b></u>on the database, it is better to prevent any possible damages when executing this kind of operations.</span></font></p>
