## Let's build the future together

We have experience in the business since 2004. Our main area of expertise is around Microsoft CRM. 

We think it is important to tell where we came from to get where we are today for you to know a little more about us.

The first project delivered (CRM 1.2), in the time was not called Dynamics, goes back to May of 2005, the client, a Portuguese government department. The project itself was something not really complex, but the tool was new and it had some peculiarities. 

"CRM 1.2 per se, only had few entities and not many customizations could be done at the time, it was only possible at the time add few fields to entities, but not new entities for example. Forget all the new things that can be done specially since version 4.0."

The project itself was to create few ASP pages and embed them in CRM 1.2. In one for example, a user could search the ID Number, we would check if it existed in CRM already, if not, we would get some extra info from an external database, create the record, and open it. 

Looking back, looks easy for what the product grew, but who worked with the product knows that everything related get/set data in/from CRM was done with FetchXML, yes, no earlybound, latebound, all XML. CRM 1.2 had few methods that we could use to interact with, probably the most used one if not the only one, called Execute. In there we would add the XML content where would identify the operation and the information to perform the action on.

But the best was what we call Plugins, at the time was something from other world at that time. What Microsoft prays from CRM 3.0 or CRM 4.0 about, DON'T TOUCH THE DATABASE, was the other way around in CRM 1.2. to use "Plugins" we had to the database and change manually some flags in not really meaningful named tables, so we could have some code behind doing something extra.

Hope this gives you some idea of how much Microsoft improved since their early versions (1.0 and 1.2) until the latest version of the product.

It has been an authentic pleasure growing around this product, so many challenging projects since our (kick off) in CRM, so many nights it not much sleep, but at the same time the filling of work well done at the end of the day when the customer really appreciates and tells you what improved their processes.
